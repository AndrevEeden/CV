            <p><em>“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a Habit.”
                  This is my motto in life and I believe anything can be achieved by consistently and deliberately
                  working
                  toward
                  a specific goal.
                  This is what inspires me to put in the maximum effort daily with everything I approach.
                  I am a fitness enthusiast, and this is also where I learn to go the extra mile even when times are
                  tough,
                  and I
                  don’t really want to.s
                  Fitness does not only benefit your personal life, but also increases your ability to perform in your
                  professional capacity.
                  I have a work ethic that will guarantee that any task I am given will not only be achieved, but the
                  results
                  will exceed expectation.
                  I want to empower anyone that works with me with the knowledge that I have.
                  Doing something on your own means that it will be done correctly while you are doing it but equipping
                  someone
                  else to do the task will ensure that it can be done correctly long after you are gone.
                  I am passionate and full of energy. This will ensure that any environment I am placed in will be
                  filled
                  with
                  positive energy, which I have
                  seen always heed better results.
                  I want to be the best in everything I do and would one day like to be the CEO of a multinational
                  company,
                  while
                  also being the healthies version of myself possible.
